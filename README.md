# StaphIn2024
In this repository we sketch the data analysis of proteomics data for Staphylococcus aureus in a experimental evolution setting and two growth conditions.

Now commited from Terminal, not yet.


Sketched here is a multifactor analysis of a LFQ-DIA experiment with multiple SA samples.

* Task1: read in data from DIANN output
* Task2: Transform, normalize, roll-up to proteins and visualize input
